# Capstone1
Springboard Capstone 1 Repository

Hello! My name is Michael Buck and welcome to the repository for my first Springboard capstone project!

In this project I used the lyrical data from the Billboard Hot 100 songs from 1965-2015 to construct a classification model whose goal was to determine what decade a song was from based on its lyrical content. You can read my final report which covers the highlights of the project and read through the powerpoint that I wrote to highlight some of the most impotant features. 

If you would like to see the in depth portions of the project, each folder here encompasses a smaller part of the project that I had to complete and submit. The chronological order that each folder was written in is as follows:
1. Data Wrangling
2. Data Story
3. Exploratory Data Analysis
4. In-Depth Analysis

In each of those folders you will find a write-up that describes the coding steps that were taken to perform each step of the project as well as a jupyter notebook that contains all of the code that was written to accomplish each of those tasks. If you have any questions about the project feel free to contact me!
